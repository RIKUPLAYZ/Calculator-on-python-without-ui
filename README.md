# Python Calculator
## What is Python Calculator (and why should you care)
Python Calculator is a terminal based calculator using just python.

I made this as a simple project to learn Python

As for why should u care... well you don't need to.

## To use this -
### Start by Running the Calc.py 

You would get some thing like this --

```
Welcome to my Project
This is a calculator
What is your name?: # <INSERT NAME>
```

### Type in a name.

For example: "Joe" or "Tina" 


### It will look something like this--

```
Hello! JOE
Use + - * / to do Actions
Press 'q' to quit
Enjoy!
Type Your First NUMBER (or 'q' to quit): # <input any number or "q" to quit>
```

Here you can type the first number. I'll use `934`

 ` 
 
Now you have to type the next number. I'll use `890`

``` 
Type The Next NUMBER : 
```
_Note: It is not possible to operate on more than 2 separate numbers at once for now. I am working to fix that._


Once you have selected two Numbers. Now its time to Select the type of operation you want to do.

You can choose from four different operations - Multiplication , Division , Addition , Subtraction.
### Codes -
>`*` for Multiplication

>`/` for Division

>`+` for Addition

>`-` for Subtraction

I'll choose `*` for Multiplication

After going through all this you will be left with this screen

```
